<h3>Media aggregator for university clubs</h3>

<b>Product description:</b> My first big project. It crawls the Internet to automatically aggregate all of the photos/videos/events/news articles relevant to clubs at your university, and then sorts them into separate pages for each club. Students used the product to discover new clubs, manage their clubsâ€™ online presence, and stay up-to-date with what was happening at their university.

<b>Technologies utilized:</b>
PHP/SQL back end
Some Javascript and a few front-end libraries
Facebook API for aggregating photos/events and for users to log in to the site to post new content
YouTube API for aggregating videos
Custom-built PHP web scrapers to aggregate news articles and events from non-Facebook sources

<b>Resources/timeline:</b> I built this product single-handedly in 6 months.
