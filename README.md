# Media Aggregator for University Clubs

#### Product Description
This web app crawls the Internet to automatically aggregate all of the photos/videos/events/news articles relevant to clubs at your university, then sorts them into separate pages for each club.

Students used the product to discover new clubs, manage their clubs’ online presence, and stay up-to-date with what was happening at their university.

#### See the Web App
This web app is no longer online, but you can still view some images of it. These are mockups, but screenshots would look identical, because I'm awesome at front end.

View the images:
- The [home page](https://dmdf3fr77elxm.cloudfront.net/portfolio_assets/62952/pictures/1435028019/original.png), which students visited to see an overview of the latest happenings at their university.
- The ["Explore"](https://dmdf3fr77elxm.cloudfront.net/portfolio_assets/62954/pictures/1435028478/original.png) page. Students used this page to discover media produced by their school's clubs. They could search by content type, category, or popularity.
- The ["Calendar"](https://dmdf3fr77elxm.cloudfront.net/portfolio_assets/62956/pictures/1435028766/original.png) page. Students used this page to discover upcoming events at their university.

#### Disclaimers
1. I made most of my commits on this repo using another Github account called "campus-bubble". This was the account I used back when I was still working with my old company. If you'd like to verify this, please contact Campus Bubble's Chief of Product, Giovanni Hobbins: giovanni@campusbubble.com

2. I built this web app when I was first learning how to make large products. I didn’t understand the importance of using an MVC framework back then, so I invented my own structure. As a result, you may find it difficult to find your way around the directory structure. To see my more recent creations that utilize MVC and MV* frameworks, please visit these repos:

  - [Advanced Internal University Social Network](https://github.com/ThePatShea/advanced-internal-university-social-network)
