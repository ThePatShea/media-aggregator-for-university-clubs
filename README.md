# Media Aggregator for University Clubs

#### Product Description
---

This web app crawls the Internet to automatically aggregate all of the photos/videos/events/news articles relevant to clubs at your university, then sorts them into separate pages for each club. Students used the product to discover new clubs, manage their clubs’ online presence, and stay up-to-date with what was happening at their university.

#### Disclaimers

---

- I made most of my commits on this repo using another Github account called "campus-bubble". This was the account I used back when I was still working with the company. If you need to verify this, please contact Campus Bubble's Chief of Product, Giovanni Hobbins: giovanni@campusbubble.com
- I built this web app when I was first learning how to make large products. I didn’t understand the importance of using an MVC framework back then, so I invented my own structure. As a result, you may find it difficult to find your way around the directory structure. To see my more recent creations that utilize MVC and MV* structures, please visit these two repos:
  - [Internal University Social Network](https://github.com/ThePatShea/internal-university-social-network)
  - [Advanced Internal University Social Network](https://github.com/ThePatShea/advanced-internal-university-social-network)
