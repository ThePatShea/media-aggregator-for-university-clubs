<h1>Media aggregator for university clubs</h1>

- Product description: My first big project. It crawls the Internet to automatically aggregate all of the photos/videos/events/news articles relevant to clubs at your university, and then sorts them into separate pages for each club. Students used the product to discover new clubs, manage their clubsâ€™ online presence, and stay up-to-date with what was happening at their university.
- Technologies utilized:
---- PHP/SQL back end
---- Some Javascript and a few front-end libraries
---- Facebook API for aggregating photos/events and for users to log in to the site to post new content
---- YouTube API for aggregating videos
---- Custom-built PHP web scrapers to aggregate news articles and events from non-Facebook sources
- Resources/timeline: I built this product single-handedly in 6 months.
